Personnal project based on [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). The purpose of this project is to create my own raycaster in C++ and add some interactions using keyboard input. The image generation is very slow so It's only for fun and can't be used for a real video game. The tutorial can be extends to an entire month project and even life long project so there a lot to see and add on that repository.      

I wanted to fully understand how raycasting works and then, maybe one day, I'll create my personnal game engine using these knowledges.
